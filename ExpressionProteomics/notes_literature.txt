Considerable systematic and random biases are introduced between the MS
runs, which makes normalization of proteomics data important [55, 56]. A
common approach is to correct the ion intensities in the spectra, either based
on specific peaks from housekeeping genes (“housekeeping peaks”) or based on
the data of all or the majority of the quantified peptides detected in the sample.
Evaluations have shown that methods that use regression-based correction of
peak abundance [40, 55], normalization of the empirical quantiles between the
replicates [44], and scaling based on the total ion intensity in relation to the
total protein length all have good and robust performance for several types
of proteomics datasets [56]. Many of the normalization techniques originally
developed for correcting gene expression microarrays have also been shown to
be suitable for proteomics data.
