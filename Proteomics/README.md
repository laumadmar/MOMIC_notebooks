# Proteomics tutorial

## Short tutorial on how to perform your own Expression Proteomics Analysis. Read user manual to get more details

Expression Proteomics includes the analysis ofâ€¯protein expression at larger scale. It helps identify main proteins in a particular sample, and those proteins differentially expressed in related samples, such as diseased vs. healthy tissue. 

Notebooks are provided as read-only templates and are self-explanatory. To create your own notebook from a template, select the desired notebook/template and click on the Duplicate button. Modify paths and code according to your needs. Alternatively, create an empty notebook from the New button located at the top left menu and follow the same steps indicated in the template.

Execute code in cells with `CTRL+ENTER` or doing click on the Run button located at the top menu. Alternative `CTRL+ALT` to create a new empty code cell bellow it. Click on Help button-> Keyboard Shortcuts to know some useful shortcuts. 

Before running a Differential Analysis, the protein intensity data and metadata need to be preprocessed. For the ilustration of this workflow, the output from raw mass spectrometry data from MaxQuant is used as input.

Follow the steps on the template and read it carefully to know more about functions and parameters that can be used to customised your analysis.
